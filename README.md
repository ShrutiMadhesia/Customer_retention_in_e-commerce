Customer satisfaction has emerged as one of the most important factors that guarantee the success of online store; it has been posited as a key stimulant of purchase, repurchase intentions and customer loyalty. A comprehensive review of the literature, theories and models have been carried out to propose the models for customer activation and customer retention. Five major factors that contributed to the success of an e-commerce store have been identified as: service quality, system quality, information quality, trust and net benefit. The research furthermore investigated the factors that influence the online customers repeat purchase intention. The combination of both utilitarian value and hedonistic values are needed to affect the repeat purchase intention (loyalty) positively.

Customer retention means the process of maintaining or keeping customers once you have acquired them. It’s all the activities that a company must do in order to keep their customers around. The goal is to build a long-lasting relationship between the brand and consumers. Once a customer becomes loyal to your brand, not only he will buy more from you than a normal customer but he’ll spread good words about your business, increase your reputation. Thus in this perticular problem solution I have used all my analysation skills to solve the problem of customer retention.


Exploratory data analysis:
* I have imported the dataset which was in excel format. Then I did all the statistical analysis like checking shape, nunique, value counts, info etc….. 
* Then while looking into the value counts I found some duplicate entries in the features i.e., two words with same meaning. I have replaced those duplicates by grouping them.
* I have checked for null values but there was no null values in the dataset.

DATA CLEANING:
Also the data type of pincode column was integer type but pincode is a code which will be given to perticular location and it will be unique so the datatype should object. So I have changed the datatype of Pincode column if I don’t change the datatype it will carry some wrong information and it may also affect my model accuracy.
